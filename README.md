# SpamMailDetection
Spam Mail Detection is a machine learning–based project that classifies emails as Spam or Not Spam (Ham) using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The system preprocesses email text, extracts features using techniques like TF-IDF, and applies classification algorithms to achieve accurate spam detection.
